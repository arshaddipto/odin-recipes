# Odin Recipes

A basic recipe website with a bunch of my favorite fast food recipes, written using plain HTML.

The purpose of the project is to mess around with basic HTML syntax, based on what I've learned from the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project. Simply went over HTML links, images, paragraph tags, and practised the Git/GitHub workflow. Also tried to practice writing good commit messages.
